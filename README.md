# Zoho L2 Interview Questions

This repository contains a collection of interview questions and their solutions for Zoho's L2 round, sourced from [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/385313847/Zoho-2nd-and-3rd-Round-Coding-Questions). 
The questions are designed to help candidates practice and prepare for coding interviews at Zoho.

### Contents
**Questions:** A list of questions taken from the [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com/document/385313847/Zoho-2nd-and-3rd-Round-Coding-Questions) document.

**Solutions:** JavaScript solutions for each question.

## Note to Reviewers:
While I have made my best efforts to solve the problems as accurately as possible, please note the following:

**1. Solution Variations:** Some of my solutions might not exactly match the expected output as mentioned in the problem statement. I have tried to handle edge cases and provide optimal solutions where possible.

**2. Custom Test Cases:** For problems where test cases were not provided, I have created my own to ensure that the solution is robust. These test cases may differ from the ones that would be used in a real interview setting, but they are designed to cover a variety of scenarios.

**3. Request for Review:**

- If you go through my code and find any errors, logical mistakes, or areas where I can improve, please feel free to review and suggest better solutions.
- I appreciate any feedback on bugs, optimizations, or conceptual improvements to the code.
- **Mistakes in logic:** If you notice any incorrect assumptions or faulty reasoning in my solutions, kindly point them out so I can recheck and learn from them.

**4. Learning Opportunity:** I am constantly looking to improve my coding skills and deepen my understanding of various algorithms and data structures. Your feedback will help me grow and refine my solutions.

Thank you for your time and contributions. I look forward to your suggestions!
